Below is a README template crafted from your commands and descriptions, suitable for a Python Flask application that uses Celery for background tasks. This README includes setup instructions, database initialization, running the application, testing, and performing specific operations like updating a provider and initiating provider updates via Celery tasks.

# Flask Application README

This README outlines the steps to set up, run, and interact with a Flask application that utilizes Celery for asynchronous task processing.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matthewvedder/provider_directory
   cd provider_directory
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows, use:

   ```cmd
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages defined in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   To update `requirements.txt` with the latest packages, run:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

### Database Setup

Initialize the database and create the necessary tables:

```python
from app.app import db
from app.models.provider import Provider
db.create_all()
```

### Running the Application

Run the Flask application:

```bash
flask run
```

### Running Celery Worker and Flower

Start a Celery worker for asynchronous task processing:

```bash
celery -A make_celery worker --loglevel INFO
```

To monitor the Celery tasks, start Flower:

```bash
celery -A make_celery flower
```

## Testing

Run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

## Usage

### Updating a Provider

To update the state of the last provider in the database:

```python
from app.models.provider import Provider
from app.app import db
last_provider = Provider.query.order_by(Provider.id.desc()).first()
last_provider.state = "OH"
db.session.commit()
```

### Initiating Provider Updates

To initiate updates for providers:

```python
from app.tasks.check_providers import initiate_provider_updates
initiate_provider_updates()
```

### TODO
- configure logging
- schedule workers with celery beat
